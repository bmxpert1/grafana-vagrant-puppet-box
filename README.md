## Installation

All hail Vagrant and Puppet for making it possible for me to share this simple recipe.

```
git clone https://github.com/pkkummermo/grafana-vagrant-puppet-box.git
cd grafana-vagrant-puppet-box
vagrant up
open http://localhost:9100/ to see Graphite running
open http://localhost:9100/grafana/ to see Grafana running
```

## SETUP
You must take into account your own needs for a graphite server. In short: this is a simple wireframe which you should put your personal touch to :)
